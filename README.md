# Unity Player Analytics

This Unity project is a tool for tracking the player's movement positions and highlighting them with a line and a box. The system is fully functional and ready to use in your Unity project.

During the duration of this project, I have created many versions of the system, some of those tests work and others do not. Mainly, there are two versions of this project one that saves the collected player position data locally and the other that saves the data to the cloud during my testing I used google firebase which worked great. However I will not be adding the google firebase version of this project, if you require this version of the project please feel free to contact me via email. 

The main final version of this script will be under the “final version” folder. This will be the most efficient version of the script. 

## Features
* Tracks player movement positions in real-time
* Saves the player movement positions values X,Y,Z
* Highlight player's path with lines and boxes used the collected data

## Usage

* Attach the script to the player object in the scene
* Configure the script in the Unity inspector as needed

* The system will begin tracking the player's movement positions and highlighting their path
* When the scene ends, data will be saved locally or could be saved to the cloud. 

## Future Enhancements
* Improving data collection performance
* Implementing a way for the developer to analyze data in real-time
* Adding more visualizations to represent the player's path
