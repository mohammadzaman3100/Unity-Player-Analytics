# Unity-Player-Analytics
The player Analytics system tracks all of the player's movement positions and then highlights them with a line and a box.

The projects code of the Analytics system has been completed, the system has functionality and works great. 

In the next couple of days, I will add more detail to the readme file and will also add some additional functionality to the system, to make it efficient and effective for external usability.
